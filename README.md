## Overview

Trimeca S.A. is a manufacturing company seeking an efficient and reliable payroll system. This project includes a PostgreSQL database designed to manage payroll, a FastAPI web service to handle data operations, and various scripts for database population and testing. The system includes features such as employee management, payroll calculation, allowance and deduction tracking, and user activity logging.

## Database Design

The database consists of several tables including:
- Employee
- Position
- Department
- Allowance
- Deduction
- Payroll
- Payslip
- Role
- UserActivityLog
- Status
- EmployeeAllowances
- EmployeeDeductions
- EmployeeExtraHours
- PayrollType

## Technologies Used

### Web Services
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Pydantic
- Uvicorn
- Psycopg2-binary

### Database Creation
- PostgreSQL
- DBeaver

Usage
To run the FastAPI application, execute the following command:

bash
Copiar c√≥digo
uvicorn main:app --reload
The API documentation will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Data Population
The data.py script is used to populate the database with dummy data. It uses the Faker library to generate realistic data for testing purposes.

Testing
The API endpoints have been tested using Postman. Various test cases have been created to ensure the correct functionality of the endpoints, including edge cases and error handling.

Results
The Payroll System project successfully implements a comprehensive solution for payroll management. The database schema supports various operations such as employee management, payroll processing, allowance and deduction tracking, and user activity logging. The FastAPI web service provides a robust interface for interacting with the database.

Conclusions
The Payroll System project demonstrates the importance of a well-designed database and a reliable web service for managing payroll operations. The integration of FastAPI with PostgreSQL provides a powerful and efficient solution. Future improvements could include additional features such as advanced reporting and analytics.
